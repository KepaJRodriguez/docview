# EHRI Admin Tutorial

## Introduction

For this tutorial we going to follow a case study of sorts, with two parts:

*Part 1*

> Allow a given user to create/update/delete both *repositories* and their *archival units*, but only for a particular country (the UK)

*Part 2*

> Create a repository for King's College London (KCL) and add the Hans Adler collection as an archival unit

#### Part 1 - Creating a group with the desired permissions, and adding a user

First, we need to create a new group. To do this, first go to the groups page (located under the 'More...' menu.)

![To create a group, first go to the More -> Groups menu ite](01_create_group_small.png)

Then, click the "Create New Group" button.

![Then, click on the 'Create New Group' button](02_create_group_small.png)

Fill out the identifier, name, and description sections in the group form. Currently, the identifier is fairly arbitrary: if in doubt, use a lowercase version of the group name. For the group name, pick something quite descriptive, and then expand on that in the description field, saying what the group is supposed to do.

In this example we'll use the following as the name: "UK Archives Subcontractors"

![Fill out the desired group properties](03_create_group_small.png)

Now we need to add permissions for our new "UK Archives Subcontractors" group to manage repositories and documentary units within the UK (and no-where else.)  For the moment, this is a little unintuitive, since we need go to the country in question and add "Scoped" permissions for our new group.

First, go to the "Countries" menu located under "More...".

![Countries are accessed through the More -> Countries menu item](04_set_country_permissions_small.png)

Then, locate the country we want via the search function and select it.

![Search for the country you want and then click on it](05_set_country_permissions_small.png)

Now click the "Manage Permissions" link on the "United Kingdom" page.

![To give a group permissions within a country, click the 'Manage Permissions' item](06_set_country_permissions_small.png)

There are two types of permissions one can manage from this page: item level and scoped. Item level permissions refer to the item itself, in this case the data for the UK country record. Scoped permissions refer to items "inside" the UK, such as repositories, and the documents those repositories contain.

We want to set the latter kind (scoped) so click the "Scoped Permissions" link.

![Then click the 'Scoped Permissions' link](07_set_country_permissions_small.png)

Now we need to choose the group we're setting permissions for. Click our "UK Archives Subcontractors" group in the list of groups.

![Select the group we want to operate on](08_set_country_permissions_small.png)

Since we want to create, update and delete items for both repositories and documentary units, check those boxes. For the moment, *ignore the owner and grant* permissions, but *do check* the "annotate" permission, since we want the users in this group to be able to link items.

![Any check the desired permissions that apply. Ignore Owner and Grant permissions for now](09_set_country_permissions_small.png)

Now we're going to create a user and add them to the "UK Archives Subcontractors" group. First, go to the Users menu (under "More...").

![To create a user, first select the More -> Users menu item](10_create_user_small.png)

Then click the "Create New User" button on the right hand side.

![The click the 'Create New User' button](11_create_user_small.png)

Fill out the user's details, such as their email address, identifier, and full name. For their identifier, just use their first name, lowercase. If the identifier already exists the system will complain and make you choose a new one. If this is a real case, use a completely random, strong password.

![Fill out the desired user properties and click 'Create User'](12_create_user_small.png)

Once the user has been created, sign out of your admin account. The next part of this tutorial will be conducted _as the new user_.

![Then sign out of the admin account](13_create_user_sign_out_small.png)

#### Part 2 - As the new user, create a new repository and add an archival unit

In the next part of this tutorial, we are going to create a new repository and add to it one archival collection. To create a repository, we first need to locate the country it resides in. This is because repositories "belong" to countries (in the database at least.)

We can search for the country we want (the UK) under the "More... -> Countries" menu.

![To create a repository, first find the country it is based in. Access countries through the More -> Countries menu item](14_create_repo_small.png)

Find the UK via the search function and select it.

![Then search for the country we want](15_create_repo_small.png)

Next, from within the UK country page, click the "Create Repository" button on the right hand side.

![From the country's page, click the 'Create Repository' button](16_create_repo_small.png)

Fill out the relevant fields, based on the ISDIAH standard.  *Note*: for the moment, just choose an arbitrary identifier field.  Then, click the "Create Repository" button at the bottom.

![Fill out the relevant ISDIAH properties for the new repository and click 'Create Repository'](17_create_repo_small.png)

When the new repository has been created we'll end up on its home page. Because collections are "held by" repositories, we can create a new collection by clicking the "Create New Collection" button on the right hand side.

![To create a new collection, go to its holding repository and click 'Create New Collection'](18_create_collection_small.png)

Just like for the repository, fill out the collection's ISAD(G) fields. You can copy them from [here](http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=8039&inst_id=6&nv1=search&nv2=). Then click "Create Collection":

![Fill out the collection's ISAD(G) properties and click 'Create Collection'](19_create_collection_small.png)

Once we've filled out the basic values, we're going to add some access points. These are not part of the main form because the functionality is slightly more complex. Access points can either be "just text" or an actual link to another "thing" on the system (i.e. an authority file or a subject term.)  Once the item has been created, go to the "Actions" menu on its description page and click "Manage Access Points".

![To manage access points, go to the Actions downdown and click 'Manage Access Points'](20_create_collection_manage_access_small.png)

To add the creator of the item, click "Add New" under the creator section. Start typing the name of the creator (in this case "Adler"). Notice that items that match that name appear in a list below. If one of them looks like what we want, click it to select. In this case ignore the documentaryUnit called ADLER... and select the "Hans G. Adler" historical agent (which means "Authority file").

![Click the 'Add New' button on the desired section and start typing the access point's name. If an existing item appears, click on it](21_create_collection_manage_access_small.png)

Finally, to create the access point and the link to the authority file, click the "Save" button.

![Then click the 'Save' button](22_create_collection_manage_access_small.png)

Repeat the process for other access points. If there is no matching item on the system, just type its name in the text box and click "Save".

![Repeat for other access points, which may or may not be in the database](23_create_collection_manage_access_small.png)
